      "reasoning": "This question aims to identify the specific operational pain points that are causing issues with donor and volunteer management. By understanding which processes are most affected, we can better recommend technology solutions that address these roadblocks. Moreover, examining the impact on donor retention and volunteer engagement provides insight into the severity of the problem and helps prioritize which aspects of the system integration should be tackled first, aligning closely with their mission to maximize community impact.",

      "answer": "Our donor thank-you process takes 2-3 weeks because we manually track donations in spreadsheets, then create individual letters. We've lost 15% of our donors this year. For volunteers, we have scheduling conflicts every week because people sign up through different channels - email, phone calls, and a paper calendar at our front desk. Three volunteers quit last month citing frustration with poor communication."
